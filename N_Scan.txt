How a network can be scanned?

1. Create a ARP packet with the target IP address,
2. Create a Ethernet Frame with Target MAC address,(the ARP packet will be sent to all devices in the local network.
3. Combine the ARP & Ethernet,
4. Send the packets and receive the responses,
5. Extract IP & MAC addresses from the responses,
6. Return the list of clients,
7. Print the scan result.

Execution :
Input will be an IP address and output will be the scanned report for all networks under that IP address.

Key difference:
IP - it's a numerical lebel assign to each devices connected to a computer network that uses some protocol.
MAC - it's a unique identifier assign to the network interface of a device, By the Manufacturer.

What is ARP?
Address Resolution Protocol, it's used to map a an IP address to a MAC address.

Features:
This project discovers devices on a network, 
It captures the network packets,
Saves the captured packets to a file.
